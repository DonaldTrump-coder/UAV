This is an overhead view captured by a drone. Based on the aircraft carrier's position in the image, provide the necessary movement instructions (move_left, move_right, move_forward, move_down) to help the drone align with the center of the aircraft carrier and descend. Once the drone is centered, provide the "land" instruction.
