Input:
- Image (top view): Captured from the UAV's top camera, showing the scene around the UAV.
//top view
Output:
- Generate UAV movement instructions based on the aircraft carrier's relative position in the images.

Logic:
1. If the aircraft carrier is not detected in the image,return:
    {"action": "move","message": "the target is without proximity"}
2. If there is a aircraft carrier in the image but the aircraft carrier is not in the center of the image, return:
    {"action": "move_slowly","message": "the drone is above on the target"}
3. If there is a aircraft carrier in the image and the aircraft carrier is in the center of the image, return: 
    {"action": "finished","message": "aircraft carrier is within proximity"}

Example output:
- {"action": "move", "message": "the target is without proximity"}
- {"action": "move_slowly","message": "the drone is above on the target"}
- {"action": "finished", "message": "aircraft carrier is within proximity"}
